# Bouldering app project in Java

> A way for climbers to track what routes they have done in the past and for setters to publish their routes.


## How boulderings works?
Bouldering is a style of climbing done close to the ground without the use of ropes and harnesses, and with crash matting for protection. 
On a single wall there are routes with a variety of difficulties from which you can choose from. For this app we will use **Font-Scale (French)** and **colours**. 

We will have these specified **grades**: 
* <span style="color:#C6FC79">(green zone beginners)</span>> 4, 5, 5+
* <span style="color:#FFE540">(yellow zone intermediate)</span> 6a, 6a+, 6b, 6b+, 6c, 6c+, 7a
* <span style="color:#FF7844">(red zone Advanced)</span> 7a+, 7b, 7b+, 7c
* <span style="color:#CE45FF">(purple zone Pro)</span> 7c+, 8a, 8a+, 8b
* <span style="color:#FFFCF8">(Whitezone Elite)</span> 8b+, 9a, 8c+ 

## What is my contribution to this community?

There are some features that I want to implement during this project:
1. A **secure way to sign-up and log-in** on the platform
2. A way for setters to **add a route image** into the database
3. **Specify on the image** what is the route itself (click on a volume and create a pointer to that volume)
4. A feature for climbers to **add their Ascents** to their profile
5. A **custom profile with stats** that are dynamically changing after each ascent. (Like in GTA 5)
6. A feature for setters to **add the routes in the archives** (for future use)
7. Setters can **grade their routes that gradually changes** due to average grade ascents of climbers that complete the route.
8. A **main page** with all routes that are active on the walls.
9. A visualization for Climbers to see their **Ascents sorted by difficulty**
10. **Most popular routes** currently on the walls.

## UML class diagram for the app:
> **_NOTE:_**
> This is a prediction, the names and functions will change along with the progress in the app.
